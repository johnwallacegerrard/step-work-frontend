      'A "first" of anything is a beginning, and so it is with the steps. Healing starts here; we will gain nothing from our program until we have worked this step. We must acknowledge our addiction, and arrive at a point of surrender. Only in working the First Step do we truly come to realize the reality of our situation. We are addicts, we are powerless over our addiction, and we MUST surrender.',

      '"We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity."',
    stepIntro:
      'Step One brings us the reality of our situation. The Second Step shows us that it is not the end of the story, that something can be done. Many are uneasy about the mention of a "Higher Power", believing that one must be religious to work the program. This is not true! The beauty of the Second Step lies in the fact that one can choose just about anything to be their Higher Power. We are encouraged to pick a Power that is loving, and caring, but most of all a Power that is greater than ourselves and can restore us to sanity. This is a spiritual, not religious, program.',
