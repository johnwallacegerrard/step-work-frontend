    stepIntro:
      'A "first" of anything is a beginning, and so it is with the steps. Healing starts here; we will gain nothing from our program until we have worked this step. We must acknowledge our addiction, and arrive at a point of surrender. Only in working the First Step do we truly come to realize the reality of our situation. We are addicts, we are powerless over our addiction, and we MUST surrender.',

      '"We came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity."',
    stepIntro:
      'Step One brings us the reality of our situation. The Second Step shows us that it is not the end of the story, that something can be done. Many are uneasy about the mention of a "Higher Power", believing that one must be religious to work the program. This is not true! The beauty of the Second Step lies in the fact that one can choose just about anything to be their Higher Power. We are encouraged to pick a Power that is loving, and caring, but most of all a Power that is greater than ourselves and can restore us to sanity. This is a spiritual, not religious, program.',

      "We made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God, as we understood Him",
    stepIntro:
      "The important part of Step 3 is a decision. The thought of making that decision may be terrifying, especially when we take a look at what it is we are deciding to do. A significant part of Step 3 is the suggestion that turn our will and our lives over to the care of the God of our understanding. By working this step, we are allowing someone or something to care for us, not control us or conduct our lives. We are accepting that a Power greater than ourseves will better care for our lives than we are capable of. During this step, we will come to some definitive conclusions about what we think 'God' means. It doesn't have to be extravegant, or complicated. It doesn't have to be like anyone elses's. Our concept of a Higher Power will grow as we grow in our recovery. Working the Third Step will help us find what works best for us. ",
